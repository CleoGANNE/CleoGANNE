### Intro ðŸ‘‹
This is a portfolio of data science work that I have completed or undertaken for academic, self-study and professional purposes. 
Most of them have been done in Python & R. I'm also enthusiastic about Data Visualisation, so you'll find some demonstrations of data visualisation projects here as well.
